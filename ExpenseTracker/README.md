# Overview

This project is a Java-based Expense Tracker that allows users to record their incomes and expenses, automatically calculates tithing, and provides insights into spending habits. The purpose of this software is to strengthen my understanding of Java programming concepts, including file handling, object-oriented programming, and basic data structures. 

The program includes features such as adding incomes and expenses, viewing all entries, calculating total expenses and incomes, and determining the remaining balance (income minus expenses). It also saves and loads data from a file to ensure persistence across sessions.

The goal of this project was to deepen my knowledge of Java's syntax, libraries, and features while building a practical and user-friendly tool.

# Future Work

- Add validation for user inputs to prevent invalid or negative entries.
- Include functionality to edit or delete specific incomes and expenses.
- Enhance the UI by aligning outputs in a tabular format.
- Add sorting features for expenses and incomes (e.g., by date, amount, or category).
- Implement categories for incomes (e.g., Salary, Freelance, Rental Income).
- Explore a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
